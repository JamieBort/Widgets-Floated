# Activity: Widgets - Practice with Flexbox - Pair Programming

## Description  
In this activity, you are given a partially completed website. Lots of the styles have been added to the CSS, but some styles have been left incomplete. The biggest task is to layout all the page elements using flexbox.

The goal of this activity is twofold: First it gives you some experience implementing a layout with flexbox. Second, it gives you some experience seeing a slightly more complex webpage. Read through all of the HTML and CSS to understand how the site is put together and then step through the TODOs to complete the layout.

This site also has two pages:

index.html - The homepage for our widgets site
products.html - The products list page for our widget site.

## Instructions  
* Download the source files and unpack them
* Review the mockups, the HTML, and CSS
* Complete all of the TODOs found in the style.css file
* Without modifying the given HTML document, style it to match the 'Widgets' mockup

## Hint  
Don't forget, with flexbox you have two ways of controlling layout: properties applied to flex containers and properties applied to flex items. Figure out which elements are containers and which are items and you are half way there.

## Solution  
A completed version of this activitiy is located in the 'solution' folder. Do your best to work throught the TODOs before you look at the solution files.
There is more than one way of achieving the layout. Your CSS properties might be slightly different from the solution file, but the result could look nearly identical. That is fine. Your goal is to match the mockup, not to exactly match the CSS file in the solution folder.
